# Unsupervised semantic analysis

This repository provides the Python code to reproduce the computational analysis of the paper: "Large-scale unsupervised spatio-temporal semantic analysis of vast regions from satellite images sequences" (Echegoyen et al., 2024).

## Table of contents

- [Code](#R-code)
- [Data and models](#Additional-data)

## Code

We provide python notebooks with experiments of the paper in the directory `experiments`.  

The directory `src` contains the [Tile2Vec code](https://github.com/ermongroup/tile2vec) with some mofications and additional functions. As indicated by the authors, the Tile2Vec LICENSE is included in this repository.

The following notebooks must be run in this order:
1. Create_grid_MTS: loads a model and creates a collection of multivariate time series by embedding sequnces of tiles.
2. Experiment_1: runs and plots the clustering of time series in differente ways, calculates qualitiy measures and explores the semantic provided by the clustering

## Data and models

An example of sequence with 3 Sentinel-2 images and the embedding models trained for the paper can be dowolad [here](https://emi-sstcdapp.unavarra.es/unsupervised-semantic-analysis.zip). The models should be in the directory `models` and the sequence of satellite images in the directory `data/NE-TXN`. The rest of images are not provided here due to space constraints, but they can be shared upon request.

Note that the results of these illustrative examples correspond to a sequence of 3 images. In the paper, we analyze a region covered by 4 images and use sequences of 20 images.
